This project build with Ktor is the backEnd for [Svelty](https://github.com/AlexKTP/Svelty) (A minimal weight tracker / Flutter Project).

## Technologies
Project is created with:

###Exposed 
>You can check out the wiki [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/Getting-Started)

Exposed is a lightweight SQL library for Kotlin that provides a simple and intuitive way to work with SQL databases. With Exposed, you can define database tables, insert and update data, and run complex queries using Kotlin code, without having to write raw SQL statements. Exposed supports a wide range of SQL databases, including H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, and is designed to work seamlessly with the Kotlin programming language.

### H2 database
>You can check out the quick start [here](https://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html)

H2 is a fast and lightweight SQL database that can be used with Java applications. H2 is written in Java and can be used as an in-memory database or as a persistent database that stores data to disk. H2 supports a wide range of SQL features, including transactions, indexes, and stored procedures, and is designed to be easy to use and configure. H2 is often used for testing and prototyping because of its simplicity and speed, but can also be used in production environments for smaller applications.

In summary, Exposed provides a simple and intuitive way to work with SQL databases in Kotlin, while H2 is a fast and lightweight SQL database that can be used with Java applications. Together, they provide a powerful and easy-to-use solution for building Kotlin applications that require a SQL database.
